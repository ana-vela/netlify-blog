Maybe you started like me - you were excited to start a blog, got it set up, and began publishing a few posts. Once the initial excitement wore off, you wondered where you'd get ideas for posts and if anyone would actually read your blog. 

With these thoughts, I started to ask myself why I wanted to start a blog in the first place. Here are some thoughts about why I blog:

## Personal Commitment

I enjoy writing, so I thought writing about tech topics would be a great way to merge these two interests. I am working on how to create better routines to make blogging a part of my schedule. With a plan, I can maintain this blog at a consistent pace.

## Being Part of a Community

With so many great topics to write about, I'd like to share my ideas with other developers. Blogging gives me opportunities to share ideas, spark a discussion with others, and extend an idea or concept to continue a conversation. 

## Challenge Myself

While I am learning programming concepts, I can share my knowledge through blog posts. Writing these posts requires me to review what I know and clarify my thinking. This is a way to get a little uncomfortable, but it is a challenge worth trying. 

## Final Thoughts

Thinking about my why helps me make a stronger commitment to blogging. It also helps me overcome writer's block whenever I am not sure what to write about next. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Why do you blog? Leave a comment to let me know!
