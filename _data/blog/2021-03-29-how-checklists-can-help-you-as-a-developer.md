While listening to an audiobook called The [Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667514-the-checklist-manifesto?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=8ZfdycgBYf&rank=1) by Atul Gawande, I thought about how checklists might be just the tool developers need to level up. In this book, Gawande shares many stories that illustrate how impactful checklists can be. Through the examples from medical professionals, pilots, and others, checklists literally saved lives and proved to be effective in working through emergencies as well as making processes more efficient in the workplace.  

## What are the Benefits of Checklists?

Through many examples, Gawande found several benefits to using a checklist. 

- With checklists as roadmaps, they helped teams catch problems sooner. They could avoid some errors since they had a plan in place if things went wrong.

- Teams had to communicate with each other while following checklists, so they had to find systems that worked for everyone.

- Creating a clear system helped maintain consistency and higher standards.

- Referencing checklists every day helped create documentation and data for further analysis. 


## Tips to Create Your Own Checklists

After enjoying this book, I thought about a simple approach to creating checklists to use as a developer. 

1. **Break down the process or project into three parts.** These can be stages or phases that signify a beginning, middle, and end to the project or process. Then you or the team can focus on one part of the checklist at a time before moving forward. 

2. **Checklists don't have to contain every single task needed.** You can structure them in a way that helps you track all the most important tasks that must be done. The point is to start using checklists and adjust them over time. 

3. **Find opportunities to level up through your checklists.** Once you have some checklists in place, you can continue to iterate on them and find ways to improve your process and/or skills. 

     ### Start by asking these questions:

     - Is there a better way to do this?
     - What questions do I have about a particular process?
     - What do I need to research if certain things are not clear?
     - What is something I want to dive deeper into?
