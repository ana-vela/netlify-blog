I've been learning programming off and on for a few years now. This year, I've gotten back into studying front-end development and building on my React skills. I'm working on a few projects now and will feature them on this site soon!

I've also started blogging! Merging tech and writing has been such a highlight for me this year. I'm getting the hang of publishing posts and am currently getting myself organized to blog consistently.
